# Project Proposal: Sorting Algorithm Library

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a versatile and efficient sorting algorithm library in C/C++. The library will provide a collection of popular sorting algorithms, each implemented as separate modules. The goal is to offer a reliable resource for programmers to integrate sorting functionality into their applications without needing to rewrite the algorithms from scratch.

## Goals

- Develop a library containing various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and shell sort.
- Implement each sorting algorithm as a separate module to ensure modularity and easy maintenance.
- Provide a consistent interface for each sorting algorithm, allowing users to provide custom comparison functions.
- Optimize the library for performance, striving to achieve efficient time and space complexity for each algorithm.
- Offer clear examples for using the sorting algorithms within different contexts.

### Usage

Users of the library can include `sort.h` in their programs and link against the compiled library (`libsort.a`). The provided comparison function will determine the order of sorting.
